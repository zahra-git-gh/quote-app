## List Quotes

We will test ListQuote component.

set some data in the state of the component and test it.

data should be an array of objects with the following properties:

```jsx

const data2 = [
  {
    id: 15,
    category: "Imagination",
    quote: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.",
    author: "Albert Einstein",
    description:
      "Einstein's perspective on the power of imagination in shaping the future.",
  },
];

```

Your array of objects should be having the following properties:

1. id
2. category
3. quote

Now you can test it by using Jest.

Test ListQuote component showing data in the component or not.
